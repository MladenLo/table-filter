# table-filter
This is just script that i did for fun.
 * Made by: MladenLo
 * v1.0
 * No licence, just a study code that i made. You may use it in your projects on your own responsibility.
 *
 * HTML code: Table rows must have at least class 'item', because javascript is using that class to catch all rows.
 * 	          Table rows must have data-filter set to the proper values.
 *            Filter buttons must have at least class '.filter-btn' and data-filter set to "value of your filter".
 *
 * JS code  : Variable activeFilters must be filled in with all filter values that you have in your HTML filter buttons.
 * 			      JS code depends on jQuery. Just include jQuery library in your HTML.
 * 		        You should "wrap" this code in $(document).ready(function() {/--HERE--/}.
 * 		        That is it :) Enjoy.
